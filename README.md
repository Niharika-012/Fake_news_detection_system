# Fake_news_detection_system
Machine Learning project

Dataset : dataset downloaded from kaggle.

Project Description:
I designed and implemented a Fake News Detection System using Machine Learning to combat the spread of misinformation and improve the reliability of news sources. The primary goal of this project was to develop an automated system capable of distinguishing between genuine and misleading news articles.

Tools and Technologies:

Python for data preprocessing and ML model development.
Libraries such as scikit-learn, Pandas, and NLTK for natural language processing.
Google Colab for code development and documentation.

Achievements:
Successfully trained a machine learning model with an accuracy rate of [mention the accuracy rate] in differentiating between genuine and fake news articles.
The system demonstrated its effectiveness in identifying misleading information and could potentially contribute to media literacy efforts.
